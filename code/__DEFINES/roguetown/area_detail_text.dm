// Putting it in defines so that it is more easily findable and editable in one location.

// STYLE GUIDE (these are SUGGESTIONS, NOT hard rules)

// people who click on this stuff obviously want to be told more abt the world. you should reward ppl for showing interest: evocative language/background info, or any combo of the two
// avoid just restating what an area looks like; roguetown is already dripping with visual/audio atmosphere. using that to set tone is good, but there should be more to the entry beyond that

// generally, we want to match the 'vibes' of the place. the terrorbog is suffocating and scary. the in-town guild is obvs less scary so we set the tone with friendlier language and by having a quote from a person!
// you don't necessarily need to do descriptions and prose. could be in-universe books or quotes or what have you (see the guild one for example)

// and, importantly: not every area needs a description! don't feel obligated!! it's ok for a place to just be A Place :3
// moderation may even be good here; the more text there is, the less impactful each entry individually becomes and the less visible

// tl;dr my advice is: match vibe, write pretty word, don't feel forced

There used to be temples here, she says. And they used to be tall and grand, and sung praises to Him in all His glory. For a moment, my mind's eagle-eye envisions a white-marble basin in upside-down ziggurat, guarded by an angelic protectorate- and then, the moment fades, and I am in the here and now. once more.\n\
One must wonder if those stygian-filligreed constructs have survived in the peat and moss."

It is still, after a thousand years, screaming upwards at the sky; acrid smoke tries to choke the firmament above and jagged cliffs try to pierce its nebulous hide. The ancient alps (old- too old for rage) have cracks in them that break the massif northwards and spill a river with cool, clear water. \n\ Tarichea, o, glowing monument!, once powered by the lava flows of Mount Golgotha, now lays drowned in them."
